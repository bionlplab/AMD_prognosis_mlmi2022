### Installation
The source codes were written in Python 3.7.1 with Tensorflow version above 2.5.0

### Data access
We used the data from AREDS, which was sponsored by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The data is publicly available upon request: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000001.v3.p1.

### To implement the model
Source codes for all models are available in src folder. Please refer model_main.py for implementation and hyperparameter setting.

Please send any questions about the code to jlee351 at gatech.edu.
